<h2 style="margin-left: 15px"> What is SEO?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 15px">SEO optimisation is a way to optimise your website in order to have it appear as a first result during searches through search engines.</p>

<h2> Importance of SEO:</h2>
<p>Importance of SEO is best seen as a way of advertisement. Does it matter if your website is exactly what the customer was looking for if he doesnt get to see it?<br>
   Most people, when searching for a web site, dont go further than 2 to 3 pages on their search engine and the websites displayed after are left unseen which is where SEO comes into play.

      <h2>Images:</h2>
      <h5>When it comes to images a very important thing is that they are loaded fast. Images slow down your web page and if it takes too long to load,
	  approximately longer than 3-5 seconds, most tend to close the webpage before it loads.</h5>
      <img src="img1.jpg" style="width: 100%">
      <p>Here is an example of a COMPRESSED image. Image compression lets us reduce the loading time of images while mostly keeping them the same.</p>

      <h2>Text:</h2>
      <p>Optimising text is related to our meta tag and keywords. Key words and meta tag dictate how many times in your pages text can or should use specific words and phrases.</p>
      <p>Noone really knows the specific number of times phrases and key words should appear in text but the approximation is between 3 to 5 %.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Meta tag</h2>
      <p>Meta tag is a really important element of search engine optimisation. </p>
      <p>Meta tag allows us to edit our key words which is a big key in SEO. But also it allows us to pick and choose the description of our website which appears during the search and some other useful things.</p>

      <h3>Javascript</h3>
      <p>Much like this text in case you have javascript thats not a key element of the page your scripts should be placed at the bottom of your code. This helps the page load at first before loading in your script which greatly improves loading times.</p>
